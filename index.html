  <h2> A CLOSER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIVES OF UNDOCUMENTED FOOD SERVICE WORKERS </h2>
  

<div class="story">
<p> All around us, everyday, people go to work to support themselves and their families. <mark>To be able to sustain themselves,</mark> a phrase that has replaced the pursuit of happiness in most people’s lives. It’s estimated that in <strong> New York City alone there is  about 535,000  to 1,200,000 undocumented people.</strong> Of this it’s estimated that almost 80 percent of these people are currently in the united states workforce  (McCarthy). This doesn’t surprise anyone, but the practice is more intricate than one might think. Everyday cash ‘payouts’ are made on registers for things like supplies, but frequently this is actually how many undocumented workers are paid. Social Security and Green Cards are faked as regularly as ID’s for teenagers going to bars. </p> <img class="img2" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/af/1c/e5af1c4ea087737239760ab04fc44e89.jpg

      </p> <p>Due to laws that seem to predate the interconnected world, another system has been implemented, <mark>a backdoor system that has expanded the economy and allowed our country to thrive, and now that is under a new threat.</mark> The matter of working undocumented was, up until recent years, easier. Programs like <s>DACA</s>, <s>TPS</s>, and <s>DED</s> have allowed many people to come here legally and stay without citizenship. DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, allows minors brought into the country to stay legally without official citizenship. TPS, Temporary Protected Status, allows individuals from countries directly affected by warfare or environmental catastrophes  to stay in the country, without official asylum. DED, Deferred Enforced Departure, prevents deportation and protects individuals from it (Cepla). <blockquote>
    <p>Under the Trump Administration these programs have been attacked.</p>
</blockquote> <p>DED, a program mostly made up of Liberians, has been effectively ended March 31, 2019. This leaves the people once protected at risk of being detained or deported. Most people living under DED and DACA have lived in the country for over a decade and face tragic uncertainties now about their future.

        <P> The narrative frequently portrayed in the news of people having to smuggle themselves in the US is semi-accurate, but typically only for people that would technically qualify for political asylum or TPS under past administrations. Many undocumented workers came here through programs or visas that expired, but a expiration date does not mean that someone can easily pick up their entire life and leave. Thousands of migrant workers have had children in the US that are citizens, that still need to be supported, regardless their parents status (Lawson).

        <blockquote>
    <p>Many of these people  who would have been able to apply for citizenship are now forced into the shadows because of increased ICE threats and the frequency that undocumented workers are detained at.</p>

<h2>SPEAKING WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYER WHO
HABITUALLY HIRES PEOPLE WITHOUT PAPERS I
TALKED THROUGH A LITTLE OF THE 
PROCESS: </h2>



  <div class="interveiw">
    
      <p>
        How do you get in touch with people that can’t apply through normal circuits? </p>

<blockquote> Word of mouth and family, other chefs who have needed to find more work for their employees have helped us make those connections. In the past we’ve started working with people, they connect us to nieces and nephews. </blockquote>

<p> How do you establish mutual trust? </p>

<blockquote> It’s just as risky for the employer as the employee, it would be stupid to report them because of that risk. Once you’re in that kind of agreement with someone it’s mutually assured destruction on both sides, so always best to stay quiet. </blockquote>

<p> Has that become riskier in recent years? </p>

<blockquote> For one things the IRS has cracked down on sending letters with social securities that don’t catch records, if you don’t take action after that you’re liable. </blockquote>

<p>What are the benefits? If so much risk is involved?</p>

<blockquote>If you’re a cash business, instead of having to use fake id numbers, then both sides can avoid taxes which are huge in the city. This city and industry is supported by undocumented immigrants, its hard to say this without generalizing, but most of the most diligent people I’ve worked with have been undocumented. You resolve some level of impunity if they can provide proof of residency, and a I9. So if an audit was to happen we’re of the hook,</blockquote>
<p>
Are these common practices in the city?</p>
<blockquote>
Depends, big corporations usually don’t because of rigorous HR, if something happens to them you risk getting sued and having to pay full medical costs
Minimum wage has sky rocketed, its put us in a funny position of wanting to pay staff as much as possible but there’s no extra revenue
Taxes when up with taxes for small business, every subscription and rent increased as well. Its a 3% increase on every increase, which ends up being 30% in ten years
There’s so many advantages to having a central corporate funding you also have the advantages of price breaks, especially liquor. They can buy in bulk for all locations and save so much on cost. Union square, hometown market, these places present as mom and pop but are backed by intense funding and discounts
All of this combine makes it beneficial to small business that face more risk, the small business community acts as almost a safe house, supplying benefits to workers and employers, but it shouldn’t have to happen outside the system. </blockquote>

      <h2> NYC </h2>
<p> In NYC specifically, many hospitality workers are undocumented. Jobs frequently rotate staff and often only require a ID, not a social security number. For these workers, especially delivery workers, that are constantly at threat even when at work. Legally, according to lawyers that specialise in undocumentary worker rights, “In New York City, you may work as an undocumented worker at restaurants, bars, delis, grocery stores, dry cleaners and other retail establishments”(Undocumented Workers). Delivering to certain streets becomes unsafe due to checkpoints,  so underground online chats have been set up in order to communicate these threats between people who have become targeted. ICE racially profiled and detains people without IDs frequently, forcing many undocumented workers to feel like they need to be in hiding (Jordan). 

It’s implied by this that due to their status they are frequently subject to employer scams. Whether that involves being paid less because it’s under the table, or being expected to do more laborious work than anyone else. It’s not uncommon for many line cooks and dishwashers in kitchens to be undocumented. It’s nearly impossible to hire a full time dishwasher, but it’s common practice to place a enormous amount of responsibility on dishwashers. 

After speaking with several restaurant owner in east village, all of which requested I did not share the name of the restaurant in order to protect their employees I learned more about this practice. One employer said he prefers hiring undocumented workers because, since they are dependent on the job, they never have issues with the amount of work required. Dishwashing is a overarching title for a typically for complex job, it involves everything from delivering to prepping to electrical and plumbing work. </p>

<h2>I talked to Edward* who works at a chef in New York. He’s been living and working here undocumented for over fifteen years, and was kind enough to sit and talk with me about that  experience. 
</h2>
  
<div class="interveiw2">
<p>When did you move here?</p>

<blockquote>Fifteen years ago. I moved from mexico to brooklyn.</blockquote>

<p>What was it like coming here?</p>

<blockquote>I moved my way through the country, I had enough money to come and visit some friends. I had many jobs between here and home. </blockquote>
<p>
Where else in the country did you live?
</p>
<blockquote>
Texas, kind of close to Houston</blockquote> 
<p>Was it more difficult to find work there?</p>
<blockquote>No, I worked some landscaping there and some office work.. but no cooking jobs,  I couldn’t find any kitchens to work in.</blockquote>

<p>Is that why you moved here?</p>
<blockquote>
Kind of, but I didn’t move here intentionally, I just found myself here after enough time. </blockquote>
<p>What do you miss about home?</p>
<blockquote>Everything, it’s beautiful... big blue skies... so sunny. In my home we make a dry molé. You bury peppers in the ground for weeks and then mash  them up. It’s similar to the sauce you know? I love cooking but food is not made the same here, it’s so much faster. I love this home too though, I love my family and this is a better home for them.</blockquote>
<p>Tell me about your family, do you have kids?</p>
<blockquote>Yes, two. They are so much. Twelve and thirteen so it’s very expensive for school. My wife is Dominican, she’s lovely.</blockquote>
<p>Is it difficult to make enough money for school here?</p>
<blockquote>For me yes and no, but I save. I cook all our meals and ride a bike to work. It’s hard but it’s possible. I’ve always been good cook and employee. No one ever has a problem with me so people trust me. That helps a lot.</blockquote>
<p>Where did you work before?</p>
<blockquote>Many places, I worked uptown, very busy restaurant on 53rd. So many people there it’s exhausting. Much quieter here. </blockquote>

<p>Do you think your employers here have been respectful and fair?</p>
<blockquote>Here, yes... but there’s a lot of bad people. People always trying to take or they’re angry. When someone does this though I don’t get angry I always just tell the truth. They yell or they lie but I never do. I quit a job because the owner was always yelling, always fighting. I wouldn’t fight with him so he hated me, so I left. </blockquote>
<p>Are they like this with everyone?</p>
<blockquote>They always yelled, but especially at me because my english was not good at the time. People, you know, they stop you from getting jobs if you aren’t fluid. It’s on the application, it’s online, you need it. 
Are there other subtle ways that employers use to discriminate potential employees?
All the social security stuff messes up the process, especially delivery jobs usually you just get paid cash, but places refuse to pay without social security to prevent hiring people. </blockquote>

<p>Has it gotten worse?</p>
<blockquote>Yes and no... I definitely hear more about ICE now, you know the people that come and take people. But I think people just worried about getting in real trouble now. More risk now.
You’ve been working at [name redacted] five years, is that kind of job security hard to find?
Yes it’s hard, it took me forever to find people like them [owners unnamed]. But once you have them, if you’re honest like me, you just stay and it’s easy then, very easy. You just find your spot. </blockquote>
